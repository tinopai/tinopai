### Hello GitHub! ðŸ‘‹
This is [my profile](https://github.com/tinopai), I'm a **TypeScript**, **Java** and **Golang** developer that knows a bit of **C++** and **PHP**.\
I mainly like doing APIs, but can also code discord bots, applications and more!

- âš¡ I'm currently learning **Python**, (even tho I hate it's syntax) because I like Machine Learning
- ðŸ”­ And I'm also looking to get decent/good at **C++**
